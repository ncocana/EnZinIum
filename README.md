## Introduction

This is an exam in Java of previous years of Proggramation in CIFP Francesc de Borja Moll. The idea was to practice Java and gain a deeper understanding of Hash Maps, and the usage of Public and Private Keys in Classes.

## About the exam

Rick is going to organize a Los Ricknillos concert and wants to put 100 tickets on sale on our EnZinIum platform.

For this he is going to use a smart contract built on our platform.

This contract will give you instructions on who to sell the tickets to.

The contract will store which users of the platform have the tickets.

Each user has an `Address` on the platform, from which they can manage their EnZinIums and tickets.
